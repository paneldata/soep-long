# From SOEPlong (v33) to SOEP in “long” format on the top level of SOEP-Core (v34)

The new wave of the [SOEP-Core](https://paneldata.org/soep-core) study
incorporates our “wide” and “long” data formats, which used to be provided to
users separately. Our aim is to eliminate any confusion about what is
available in which format and to make data use easier overall. After several
years of testing SOEPlong as an additional and separated service, we now
provide all datasets in the “long” format (former SOEPlong) as a standard part
of our SOEP data release. 

In the top-level (or root) directory of our data release, you will find all of
the datasets provided up to now with SOEPlong (pl, ppfadl/ppathl, etc.) as well as
all of the additional datasets formerly provided only in our classic “wide”
format (biographical or spell data such as bioparen, artkalen, etc.). 
**All of the data in the main SOEP-Core study are therefore contained in the
datasets in the top-level directory.**

Feedback from experienced and beginning users over the past several years
shows that the “long” data offer significant advantages in ease of use,
particularly for beginners. We have therefore decided to use this as our
primary data format in future data releases.

A more detailed description of the format of our SOEP-Core data release can be
found in our new [SOEPcompanion](http://companion.soep.de/Data%20Structure%20of%20SOEPcore/index.html#data-distribution-file).
